It demonstrates the process of loading data, defining a neural network architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance on a classification task. It is intended to provide a practical demonstration of how to implement a simple classification pipeline using Python and popular deep learning libraries.


3. **Init_weights.py**
   - Description: This Python script defines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using PyTorch. It includes convolutional and pooling layers, as well as fully connected layers for classification. The script initializes the network's weights and biases using the Kaiming initialization method and provides a method for forward pass computation. Additionally, it allows for inspection of the model's parameters. This CNN architecture serves as a foundational building block for various image classification tasks, offering a flexible and customizable framework for deep learning projects.


4. **Neural Style Transfer (Pytorch).py**
   - Description: The provided Python script utilizes PyTorch to perform neural style transfer. It employs a pre-trained VGG19 model to extract features from content and style images, optimizing a generated image to minimize content and style losses. The script iteratively updates the generated image using the Adam optimizer and periodically saves the result.

5. **Progress_bar.py**
   - Description: This script illustrates the implementation of a progress bar for monitoring training progress during the training of machine learning models. A progress bar is a visual indicator that provides real-time feedback on the progress of a long-running task, such as model training. By displaying the progress of epochs or batches, it helps users track the training process, estimate remaining time, and identify potential issues such as slow convergence or overfitting.


6. **Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning VGG16.py**
   - Description: This Python script utilizes PyTorch to perform neural style transfer with support for parallel processing on multiple GPUs. It employs a pre-trained VGG19 model to extract features from content and style images and optimizes a generated image using the Adam optimizer to minimize content and style losses. The script iteratively updates the generated image and periodically saves it. It leverages CUDA for GPU acceleration and supports parallel processing across multiple GPUs using PyTorch's DataParallel module. Overall, it provides an efficient and scalable implementation of neural style transfer.


7. **save_load.py**
   - Description: This PyTorch script illustrates the process of saving and loading model checkpoints. It initializes a VGG16 model and an Adam optimizer for training, saves a checkpoint, and then loads and applies the checkpoint. This functionality ensures the preservation of training progress and model parameters, facilitating efficient experimentation and deployment.
